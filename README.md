# Welcome to ForkingIdiots 🍴🤪

You've found it. The digital cesspool of code deviants.

🌑 We embrace bugs. They're not mistakes, they're "features."
🔮 Our cult worships caffeine and questionable practices.
💀 Weekends? Sacrificed to Debug Hell.

Our motto: "It works on my machine."

Think you can handle it? Dive in. No safe word.

May your code be as dirty as your mind.
